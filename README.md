# InventoryControl
Saves and Stores Book, CD, and DVD metadata in a SQL Server database, named INVENTORY*.

*NOTE: At some point, before you run the SQL files to create each table, you must create a new database, (I used LocalDB), named INVENTORY.

**NOTE: This project is in its very early stages and is largely unfinished. Please don't judge me harshly. Thank You!!
